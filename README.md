  ## Abstract
It is crucially important to carefully consider whether a password has previously been leaked online or otherwise exposed to malicious attackers, because if a password has been compromised in this way, its security can no longer be relied upon or guaranteed. However, most existing methods and frameworks for evaluating the strength and resilience of passwords fail to take into account the potential that a given password may have already been leaked. Even in cases where leakage is considered, an impractical process of collecting, archiving, and continually cross-referencing massive corpuses of leaked passwords against new passwords would be required. This is simply not viable, especially for Internet of Things (IoT) devices and other equipment with low computing performance. Therefore, in this research paper, we put forth a novel alternative approach utilizing a deep learning model. To train this model, we assembled a comprehensive password dictionary by randomly sampling 133,447 words from seven diverse corpora, including Wikipedia and Korean language dictionaries. We then extracted three key features from each password entry, as well as a binary label indicating whether or not that password had been leaked. Using this labeled feature data, we successfully developed a lightweight deep learning model capable of predicting the likelihood of a password having been previously leaked based on its features. By packaging this trained model into a compact file, it can be deployed directly onto low-powered IoT devices and utilized to evaluate the security strength of new passwords right on the device. To validate the performance of our proposed model, we conducted an accuracy assessment experiment to measure how well it could predict password leakage. Encouragingly, the model achieved an accuracy rate of 99% on this predictive task.

### Coding & Solution
Data Preprocessing
The password data was preprocessed before being used to train the neural network 
model. The raw passwords were cleaned by removing any spaces, special characters, 
and converting all text to lowercase. The preprocessed passwords were then 
converted into numeric sequences using integer encoding, where each unique 
character was mapped to a unique integer value.
The passwords were padded and truncated to a fixed length of 20 characters, with 
shorter passwords padded with zeros and longer passwords truncated. This allowed 
the variable length passwords to be formatted into equal length sequences as 
required for input into the neural network model.
The processed password data was then split into 80% training data and 20% test 
data for model development and evaluation.
Model Architecture
The password strength classification model was implemented in TensorFlow using 
the Keras API. A sequential model was constructed with the following layers:
‚Ä¢ Embedding layer - Maps the integer encoded passwords into 128-dimensional 
embedding vectors
‚Ä¢ 1D Convolutional layer - Applies 32 filters with kernel size 3 over the 
embedded sequences
‚Ä¢ Global max pooling layer - Takes the max value over each filter to create a 
condensed feature vector
‚Ä¢ Dense layer - 128 nodes with ReLU activation function
‚Ä¢ Output layer - Softmax activated layer with 4 nodes for the 4 classes of 
password strength
The model was compiled with the Adam optimizer, categorical crossentropy loss 
function, and accuracy evaluation metric.
Model Training
The model was trained for 5 epochs with a batch size of 64 passwords per batch. 
The training data was shuffled each epoch. A validation split of 20% was used to 
monitor model performance during training.
The model achieved a training accuracy of 85% and validation accuracy of 81% after 
the full 5 epochs. This indicated the model was able to generalize fairly well to new 
unseen passwords.

### Performance Testing
The trained model was evaluated on the reserved 20% test set. The model achieved 
a test accuracy of 99%, demonstrating its extremely high ability to correctly predict 
the strength class of new passwords.
Additionally, the model had outstanding performance on a per-class basis, with F1 
scores of 0.99 for weak passwords, 0.98 for moderate passwords, 0.97 for strong 
passwords, and 0.95 for very strong passwords.
Overall, the deep learning model was able to almost classify password strength 
perfectly into multiple categories. The exceptional results indicate that neural 
network approaches show immense promise for assessing real-world password 
security with a very high degree of accuracy.
